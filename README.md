## DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A GAME
**Falculator is a simulation engine, not a crystal ball.** While the math is deterministic, the future is not. This software is designed for entertainment, educational modeling, and "what-if" scenario stress-testing. **It is not certified financial advice.** If you bet your life savings on a strategy because it worked in "Interactive Mode" and lose it all, that is a skill issue, not a software bug.

A Gamified Financial Simulator inspired by the following games:

- [Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress)
- [Plague Inc](https://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/22-plague-inc)
- [Space Trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Trader_(Palm_OS))
